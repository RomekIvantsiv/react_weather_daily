# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Weather React application
## [DEMO LINK](https://romekivantsiv.github.io/react_weather_daily/)

### What can You do in this app? 
* By default you will see the current weather forecast for the Warsaw.
* You can click on the city on the top and get the current weather in that city (hourly weather, daily weather and all the details, and of course, that's not all :)
* Just type  the city you want in an input field, press Enter or click the ðŸ”Ž and you will get the weather for your city (if city not found you'll see the message)...and of course that's also not all :)
* If you click the `location icon` near the ðŸ”Ž, you'll see the weather where you are located in (just make sure that browser have access to your geolocation)...and as you might have guessed, that's also not all :)
* You can choose in which format you want to see the weather (Celsius or Fahrenheit), just click `Â°C` or `Â°F`
* If the temperature is higher than `30Â°` the background will change.

## Technology stack:
* React
* TypeScript
* For styling the Tailwind library

## Local development

### Dependencies
* Node v14.19.1 and higher
* NPM v6.14.4 and higher

### Installing
* Fork and clone this repository
* Run `npm install` in your terminal
* Run `npm start`

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
